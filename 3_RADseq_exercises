## Setting up your work station

1. On the university computers, log into Ubuntu. Alternatively, run your live Lubuntu from your USB drive. 
2. Install `conda` using the following commands (source: https://ipyrad.readthedocs.io/en/master/3-installation.html#longform). The full instructions are on the `ipyrad` website. 

```
# Fetch the miniconda installer with wget
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Install miniconda into $HOME/miniconda3
#  * Type 'yes' to agree to the license
#  * Press Enter to use the default install directory
#  * Type 'yes' to initialize the conda install
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Refresh your terminal session to see conda
bash
